# Project Title: 02_Challenge_QualifyingLoans

**Fintech boot camp challenge for Module 2**

This program reads in a .csv file of the following information and given a users input of credit_score, debt, income, loan, home_value, will calculate a users monthly_debt_ratio and loan_to_ratio and use this info to filter back loans that the user can qualify for.  These loans are then outputted to another .csv file.

Example: 
'''
Lender,Max Loan Amount,Max LTV,Max DTI,Min Credit Score,Interest Rate
Bank of Big - Premier Option,300000,0.85,0.47,740,3.6
West Central Credit Union - Premier Option,400000,0.9,0.35,760,2.7
