Fintech boot camp challenge for Module 2

This program reads in a .csv file of the following information and given a users input of credit_score, debt, income, loan, home_value, will calculate a users monthly_debt_ratio and loan_to_ratio and use this info to filter back loans that the user can qualify for.  These loans are then outputted to another .csv file.
