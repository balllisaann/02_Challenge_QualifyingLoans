# Find Qualifying Loans

This program reads in a .csv file of bank information and given user input of credit_score, debt, income, loan, home_value, will calculate a users monthly_debt_ratio and loan_to_ratio and use this info to filter back loans that the user can qualify for.  These loans are then outputted to another .csv file.

## Technologies

Programming language: Python
Libraries used: sys, fire, questionary, csv, Path(pathlib)

## Usage

This Miro board was so, so painful to create size correctly so it could be outputted as an image file.  Please, there has to be something easier.

Install Python.

## Contributing

UW FinTech Boot Camp 2021 provided most of the files.  The only functions that I created were csv_save(), save_qualifying_loan() and this README file.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
